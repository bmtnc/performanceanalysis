\title{Check for Common Matrix Problems}
\usage{
validate_regression_predictors(x, cor_threshold = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix (design matrix) to check.}

\item{cor_threshold}{Numeric scalar; correlation threshold above which to fail (default 0.99).}
}
\value{
NULL (called for side effects - throws error if problems found)
}
\description{
Validates that a design matrix doesn't have obvious problems that would
make coefficient estimation unreliable. Checks for highly correlated
predictors, constant columns, and insufficient observations.
}
\details{
This function performs three critical checks:
\enumerate{
\item Too Many Predictors vs. Observations
If you have more predictors than observations (p >= n), there are infinite
possible solutions. Solution: reduce predictors or collect more data.
\item Constant Columns
Columns with no variation provide zero information for prediction.
Solution: remove these columns or check your data filtering.
\item Highly Correlated Predictors
When predictors are nearly identical (correlation > 0.99), coefficients
become unstable and hard to interpret. Solution: remove one of the
correlated predictors or combine them.
}

These checks are especially important for constrained regression because
constraints make optimization more sensitive to data quality issues.
